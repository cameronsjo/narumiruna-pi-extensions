# Extension Independence Audit

Last reviewed: 2026-08-30.

This is a small snapshot of known gaps against the repository rule that extension packages remain
independently installable and semantically self-contained. It records existing behavior; fixes belong
in separate, package-focused changes.

## Summary

The package/import boundary is healthy: `npm run check:boundaries` passes for every active package.
No active extension directly imports or declares a dependency on another extension package.

Three extensions still contain extension-specific runtime knowledge:

| Extension | Existing coupling |
| --- | --- |
| `pi-statusline` | Its extension-status settings and renderer contain known-extension icon/compatibility maps and parse the `github-pr` status format. |
| `pi-accounts` | `src/account-store.ts` reads and migrates settings owned by the deprecated `pi-codex-accounts` extension. |
| `pi-caffeinate` | Its deprecated-icon warning names `pi-statusline` and describes that extension's settings shape. This is message-only coupling. |

## Audit Boundary

Generic use of Pi-owned surfaces—such as enumerating tools, rendering arbitrary status keys, or
observing lifecycle events without package-specific branching—is not a violation. Documentation-only
comparisons and migration instructions are also excluded here because they do not change runtime
behavior.

Removing these gaps may change published compatibility behavior, especially settings migration and
status rendering. Review and verify each package independently rather than combining the cleanup into
this guidance change.
